# 🧠 Crime Analysis Dashboard – India (Power BI Project)

## 📄 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using real-world crime data across different states and years in India. The goal is to identify crime trends, top crime categories, and states with high/low incident rates to assist law enforcement and policy planning.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Year-wise crime records
- Crime categories (e.g., Theft, Murder, Assault)
- State/UT-wise reported cases
- Gender-based victim data (if available)

## 🎯 Key Insights
- 📈 **Top 5 States** with highest overall crime rates
- 🚔 **Most Reported Crime Types** across India
- 📉 **Crime Trend by Year** showing increase/decrease in reported cases
- 🌍 **Geographical Heatmap** to visualize high-crime regions
- 👥 **Victim Demographics** (e.g., male/female if data was present)

## 🧰 Tools & Features Used
- ✅ Power BI (Data Model, Relationships, DAX Measures)
- ✅ Filters by Year, State, Crime Type
- ✅ Visuals: Bar Chart, Line Chart, Map, KPI Cards

## 📌 How This Project Helps
This dashboard can help:
- Policymakers identify high-risk states and categories
- Citizens understand crime distribution
- Agencies allocate resources efficiently

## 🧑‍💼 Role
I built this dashboard from scratch:
- Cleaned and transformed data
- Built data model in Power BI
- Created DAX measures and visuals
- Delivered key insights via storytelling
